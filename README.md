# Cyber Security Project ReadMe

Welcome to the Cyber Security Project. This project is designed to provide robust and scalable cybersecurity solutions using Node.js, Express, Airtable, and Body-parser. Follow this step-by-step guide to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm, the Node.js package manager).

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Download Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) on your system.

### 2. Initialize npm

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project. Run the following command to initialize npm and create a `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

The `-y` flag uses the default settings, allowing you to skip the questionnaire.

### 3. Install Express

Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. Install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express
```

### 4. Install Airtable

Airtable is a cloud collaboration service that provides database features. Install the Airtable npm package by running:

```bash
npm install airtable
```

### 5. Install Body-Parser

Body-parser is a middleware to handle JSON, Raw, Text, and URL encoded form data. Install it by running:

```bash
npm install body-parser
```

### 6. Start the Server

To start your server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node app.js
```

This command will start the application using the `app.js` file located in the root directory of your project.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. Make sure to replace `3000` with the actual port number your server is configured to run on, if different.
